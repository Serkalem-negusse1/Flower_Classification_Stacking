# Stacking Classifier Project: Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates the power of **stacking ensemble methods** by combining multiple classifiers into a meta-model that aims to outperform individual base models. We use the classic Iris dataset for this classification task.

## Project Overview

This project illustrates the application of stacking ensemble techniques for classification using the Iris dataset. It covers the following key steps:-
1.  **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading and initial examination of the Iris dataset.
2.  **Base Model Training**: Training various Level-0 base models.
3.  **Stacking Implementation**: Demonstrating the use of `sklearn`'s built-in `StackingClassifier`.
4.  **Performance Comparison**: Evaluating the performance of the stacked model against individual base models.

## Dataset

This notebook exclusively uses the **Iris Flower Dataset**, a well-known dataset in machine learning for classification tasks, consisting of measurements of iris flowers from three different species.

## Key Steps

The notebook is structured into several key steps:

### 1. Import Libraries
Necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization are imported, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and various modules from `sklearn` such as `datasets`, `model_selection`, `preprocessing`, `linear_model`, `svm`, `ensemble` (for `RandomForestClassifier` and `StackingClassifier`), `neighbors`, and `metrics`.

### 2. Load and Explore Data
The Iris dataset is loaded using `load_iris()`. The data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and exploration. The notebook displays the dataset shape, the first few rows, and the class distribution. A pairplot is also generated to visualize the relationships between features and class distributions.

### 3. Base Model Training
Level-0 base models are defined. These include:
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Random Forest Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier

### 4. Stacking Implementation
The notebook demonstrates stacking using `sklearn.ensemble.StackingClassifier`. Base models are passed to the `StackingClassifier`, which then trains a final estimator (meta-model), such as Logistic Regression, on the predictions of the base models.

## Results and Key Takeaways

The project provides insights into the effectiveness of stacking ensemble methods for the Iris classification task.
* **Stacking Performance**: The stacked model achieved an accuracy of `0.9737`.
* **Model Diversity Matters**: Stacking generally performs best when the base models make different types of errors.
* **Practical Use**: While stacking may not significantly outperform individual models on simpler datasets like Iris, the technique's true potential is realized on complex real-world data.

## Next Steps

To further enhance this project, you can consider:-
* Experimenting with different meta-models (e.g., GradientBoosting or Neural Networks).
* Adding more diverse base models (e.g., Naive Bayes, XGBoost).
* Applying the stacking technique to other complex real-world datasets.
